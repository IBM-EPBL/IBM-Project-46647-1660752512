Industry-specific intelligent fire management system 

 

Fire alarm systems are only effective if they can generate reliable and fast fire alerts with exact location of fire. 
There is a direct correlation between the amount of damage caused by fire and interventions time in various fire alarm systems.
As the time of intervention decreases, the damage also decreases.
Hence the most important factor in a fire alarm system is the reaction or response time of fire alarm system, that is, the time between fire detection and extinguishing.
